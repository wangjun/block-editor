# Pinpoint Block Editor

> A Notion-like notebook editor used at Pinpoint

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @pinpt/block-editor
```

## Development

It's recommended to open up two tabs in terminal: one for building the library, one for running the examples.

**This will build your bundle as you change files (rollup with watch):**

```bash
npm start
```

**`cd` in to `examples` and start the react dev server (CRA app):**

```bash
npm start
```

Now as you make changes, you will see them reflected in this sample app.
